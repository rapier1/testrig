.PP
The \f(CW\*(C`knownhosts\*(C'\fR object allows one to manipulate the entries in the
\&\f(CW\*(C`known_host\*(C'\fR file usually located at \f(CW\*(C`~/.ssh/known_hosts\*(C'\fR and which
contains the public keys of the already known hosts.
.PP
The methods currently supported are as follows:
.SS "readfile (filename)"
.IX Subsection "readfile (filename)"
Populates the object with the entries in the given file.
.PP
It returns the number or entries read or undef on failure.
.SS "writefile (filename)"
.IX Subsection "writefile (filename)"
Saves the known host entries to the given file.
.SS "add (hostname, salt, key, comment, key_type|host_format|key_format)"
.IX Subsection "add (hostname, salt, key, comment, key_type|host_format|key_format)"
Add a host and its associated key to the collection of known hosts.
.PP
The \f(CW\*(C`host_format\*(C'\fR argument specifies the format of the given host:
.PP
.Vb 3
\&    LIBSSH2_KNOWNHOST_TYPE_PLAIN  \- ascii "hostname.domain.tld"
\&    LIBSSH2_KNOWNHOST_TYPE_SHA1   \- SHA1(salt, host) base64\-encoded!
\&    LIBSSH2_KNOWNHOST_TYPE_CUSTOM \- another hash
.Ve
.PP
If \f(CW\*(C`SHA1\*(C'\fR is selected as host format, the salt must be provided to
the salt argument in base64 format.
.PP
The \s-1SHA\-1\s0 hash is what OpenSSH can be told to use in known_hosts
files. If a custom type is used, salt is ignored and you must provide
the host pre-hashed when checking for it in the \f(CW\*(C`check\*(C'\fR method.
.PP
The available key formats are as follow:
.PP
.Vb 2
\&    LIBSSH2_KNOWNHOST_KEYENC_RAW
\&    LIBSSH2_KNOWNHOST_KEYENC_BASE64
.Ve
.PP
Finally, the available key types are as follow:
.PP
.Vb 3
\&    LIBSSH2_KNOWNHOST_KEY_RSA1
\&    LIBSSH2_KNOWNHOST_KEY_SSHRSA
\&    LIBSSH2_KNOWNHOST_KEY_SSHDSS
.Ve
.PP
The comment argument may be undef.
.SS "check (hostname, port, key, key_type|host_format|key_format)"
.IX Subsection "check (hostname, port, key, key_type|host_format|key_format)"
Checks a host and its associated key against the collection of known hosts.
.PP
The \f(CW\*(C`key_type|host_format|key_format\*(C'\fR argument has the same meaning
as in the \*(L"add\*(R" method.
.PP
\&\f(CW\*(C`undef\*(C'\fR may be passed as the port argument.
.PP
Returns:
.PP
.Vb 4
\&    LIBSSH2_KNOWNHOST_CHECK_MATCH    (0)
\&    LIBSSH2_KNOWNHOST_CHECK_MISMATCH (1)
\&    LIBSSH2_KNOWNHOST_CHECK_NOTFOUND (2)
\&    LIBSSH2_KNOWNHOST_CHECK_FAILURE  (3)
.Ve
.SS "readline (string)"
.IX Subsection "readline (string)"
Read a known_hosts entry from the given string.
.PP
For instance, the following piece of code is more or less equivalent
to the readfile method:
.PP
.Vb 7
\&  my $kh = $ssh2\->known_hosts;
\&  if (open my $fh, \*(Aq<\*(Aq, $known_hosts_path) {
\&      while (<>) {
\&          eval { $kh\->readline($_) }
\&             or warn "unable to parse known_hosts entry $_";
\&      }
\&  }
.Ve
.SS "writeline (hostname, port, key, key_type|host_format|key_format)"
.IX Subsection "writeline (hostname, port, key, key_type|host_format|key_format)"
Searches the entry matching the given parameters (as described in the
\&\*(L"check\*(R" method) and formats it into a line in the known_hosts
format.
.PP
This method returns undef when some error happens.
.PP
This method should be considered experimental, the interface may
change.
