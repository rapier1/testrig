.SH NAME
bwctl \- Client application to request throughput tests.
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B bwctl 
[\fIoptions\fR] \fI\-c recvhost \-s sendhost\fR
.br
.B bwctl 
[\fIoptions\fR] \fI\-c recvhost\fR
.br
.B bwctl 
[\fIoptions\fR] \fI\-s sendhost\fR
.SH DESCRIPTION
\fBbwctl\fR is a command line client application that is used to
initiate throughput tests.
.TP
This version of \fBbwctl\fR is capable of initiating \fBIperf\fR, \fBNuttcp\fR, and \fBThrulay\fR tests.
.PP
.B bwctl
works by
contacting a \fBbwctld\fR daemon on both the receiving host and
the sending host. \fBbwctld\fR manages and schedules the resources
of the host it runs on.
In the case where only one of the receiving host or
sending host is specified, \fBbwctl\fR assumes the local host is the
other endpoint. \fBbwctl\fR will attempt to contact a local \fBbwctld\fR
if it can. If there is no local \fBbwctld\fR running, \fBbwctl\fR assumes
the local host does not require policy controls and will execute the
\fBbwctld\fR functionality required to run the test directly.
.PP
If cases where \fBbwctl\fR is directly running the throughput test
on the host, there are several configuration options that are shared
with \fBbwctld\fR. Those configuration options
can be set using the bwctlrc(5) configuration file in a way very similar
to the way they are specified in the bwctld.conf(5) file.
.PP
The \fBbwctl\fR client is used to request the desired type of throughput
test. Furthermore, it requests \fIwhen\fR the test is wanted.
\fBbwctld\fR on each endpoint either responds with a tentative
reservation or a \fBtest denied\fR message. Once \fBbwctl\fR is able to get
a matching reservation from both \fBbwctld\fR processes (one for each
host involved in the test), it confirms the
reservation. Then, the \fBbwctld\fR processes run the test and return the
results. The results are returned to the client from both sides of the
test from the respective \fBbwctld\fR processes. Additionally, the
\fBbwctld\fR processes share the results from
their respective side of the test with each other.
.PP
\fBBWCTL\fR (\fBbwctl\fR and \fBbwctld\fR) is used to enable
non-specific throughput tests
to hosts without having to give full user accounts on the given systems.
Users want the ability to run throughput tests to determine the achievable
or available bandwidth between a pair of hosts. It is often useful to test
to multiple points along a network path to determine the network
characteristics along that path. Typically, users who want to do this path
decomposition have to directly contact the network/system administrators
who control the hosts along the path. The administrator needs to either
run half of the test for the user or give them a user account on the host.
Also, network paths of interest are typically controlled by
multiple administrators. These hurdles have made this kind of testing
difficult in practice. 
.PP
\fBBWCTL\fR was designed to help with this problem. It allows an
administrator to configure a given host as an \fBIperf\fR, \fBThrulay\fR, or
\fBNuttcp\fR endpoint.  The endpoint can be a packet sender (e.g. \fBIperf\fR
client) or a packet receiver (e.g. \fBIperf\fR server). It can be shared by
multiple users without concern that those users will interfere with each other.
Specific policy limits can be applied to specific users, and individual tests
are scheduled so they will not interfere with each other. Additionally, full
user accounts are not required for the users running the tests.
.PP
\fBBWCTL\fR allows the administrator to classify incoming connections
based upon a user name and AES key combination or, alternatively, based
upon an IP/netmask.
Once the connection is classified, the \fBbwctld\fR can determine the
exact type and intensities of througput tests that will be allowed.
More information on the policy controls can be found in the bwctld(8)
man page.
.PP
\fBBWCTL\fR makes use of a distributed scheduling algorithm. Each host
maintains a schedule independently. As a client requests a test, the two
endpoints are contacted and each \fBbwctld\fR server responds with the first
available open schedule slot. This enables on-demand tests to co-exist
with regularly scheduled tests since regularly scheduled tests are implemented
by having the client request tests on regular intervals. Different
priorities can be implemented using the \fIevent_horizon\fR configuration
directive to \fBbwctld\fR. (By allowing clients that implement regularly scheduled
tests to reserve their time slots further into the future.)
.SH ARGUMENTS
.SS Connection/Authentication Arguments:
.TP
\fB\-4\fR
Forces bwctl to use IPv4 addresses only.
.RS
.IP Default:
Unspecified (IPv6 is preferred).
.RE
.TP
\fB\-6\fR
Forces bwctl to use IPv6 addresses only.
.RS
.IP Default:
Unspecified (IPv6 is preferred).
.RE
.TP
\fB\-A\fR \fIauthmethod\fB
\fIauthmethod\fR is used to specify the authentication method the
\fBbwctl\fR client is willing to use for communication with the \fBbwctld\fR
on the \fIsendhost\fR and \fIrecvhost\fR.
The authentication options of
\fBbwctl\fR are intended to be extensible. The communication from the
\fBbwctl\fR client to each \fBbwctld\fR server may take different options
for different types of authentication.
If the \fIauthmethod\fR option is specified for either the \fB\-s\fR,
or the \fB\-c\fR argument, it overrides the \fIauthmethod\fR specified
with the \fB\-A\fR option for communication with that particular host.
(Therefore, the \fB\-A\fR argument is really only useful if the same
authentication can be used with both hosts.)
.RS
.PP
Allowing different authentication methods for each connection should allow
a client to use different authentication methods with different servers
which should in turn allow cross-domain tests to occur more easily.
.PP
The format for \fIauthmethod\fR is:
.PP
\fIauthmode [authscheme schemeopts]\fR
.TP
\fIauthmode\fR
Specifies the authentication mode the client is willing to speak with
a server. It must be set as a character string with
any or all of the characters "AEO". The modes are:
.RS
.IP \fBA\fR
[\fBA\fR]uthenticated. This mode encrypts the control connection.
.IP \fBE\fR
[\fBE\fR]ncrypted. This mode encrypts the control connection. If the
test supports encryption, this mode will additionally encrypt the test
stream. (Encryption of the test stream is not currently supported, so
this mode is currently identical to authenticated.)
.IP \fBO\fR
[\fBO\fR]pen. No encryption of any kind is done.
.PP
The client can specify all the modes with which it is willing to communicate.
The most strict mode that both the server and the client are willing to use
will be selected.
.IP Default:
"AEO"
.RE
.TP
\fIauthscheme schemeopts\fR
\fIauthscheme\fR indicates the authentication scheme that should be used to
achieve the \fBauthenticated\fR or \fBencrypted\fR modes.
\fIschemeopts\fR are a list of arguments specific to each particular
authentication scheme. Supported \fIauthscheme\fR values follow
(listed with the \fIschemeopts\fR each scheme requires):
.RS
.TP
\fBAESKEY\fR \fIuserid [keyfile]\fR
This is the initial "simple" shared secret (AES key) model. \fIuserid\fR
is required to identify which shared secret the server and client should
use. \fIkeyfile\fR optionally specifies a file to retrieve the AES key
from. If \fIkeyfile\fR is not specified, the user will be prompted for a
\fIpassphrase\fR. \fIkeyfile\fR can be generated using the aespasswd(1)
application.
.IP "Default:"
Unauthenticated
.RE
.PP
\fIauthscheme\fR and \fIschemeopts\fR are only needed if authenticated
communication (\fBA\fR or \fBE\fR modes of \fIauthmode\fR)
is wanted with \fIsendhost\fR and \fIrecvhost\fR.
.RE
.TP
\fB\-B\fR \fIsrcaddr\fR
Bind the local address of the client socket to \fIsrcaddr\fR. \fIsrcaddr\fR
can be specified using a DNS name or using standard textual notations for
the IP addresses.
.RS
.IP Default:
Unspecified (wild-card address selection).
.RE
.TP
\fB\-c\fR \fIrecvhost[:port] [authmethod]\fR
Specifies the host that will run the \fBIperf\fR, \fBThrulay\fR or \fBNuttcp\fR server.
The :port suffix is optional
and is only needed if \fBbwctld\fR is being run on a non-default
port number. If an IPv6 address is being specified, note that the accepted
format contains the \fIrecvhost\fR portion of the specification in square
brackets as: [fe80::fe9f:62d8]:4823.
This ensures the port number is distinct from the address specification, and
is not needed if the :port suffix is not being used.
.RS
.PP
At least one of the \fB\-c\fR or \fB\-s\fR options must be specified. If
one of them is not specified, it is assumed to be the local host.
.PP
\fIauthmethod\fR is a specifically ordered list of keywords that
is only needed if authenticated communication is wanted with \fIrecvhost\fR.
These keywords are used
to describe the type of communication and authentication that should be
used to contact the \fIrecvhost\fR.
If \fIrecvhost\fR and \fIsendhost\fR share
the same authentication methods and identities, it is possible to
specify the authmethod for both \fIrecvhost\fR and \fIsendhost\fR
using the \fB\-A\fR argument.
An \fIauthmethod\fR specified with
the \fB\-c\fR option will override an \fIauthmethod\fR specified
with the \fB\-A\fR argument for communication with the \fIrecvhost\fR.
.PP
The format for \fIauthmethod\fR and a description of the
currently available authentication
methods are described with the \fB\-A\fR argument.
.RE
.TP
\fB\-k\fR
.br
This option has been deprecated. Originally, it was used to specify the
keyfile for authentication.
All authentication options can now be specified
using the \fB\-A\fR argument.
For the next several versions this option will
report an error. Eventually, it may be reclaimed for another purpose.
.RE
.TP
\fB\-s\fR \fIsendhost[:port] [authmethod]\fR
Specifies the host that will run the \fBIperf\fR, \fBThrulay\fR or \fBNuttcp\fR client.
The :port suffix is optional
and is only needed if \fBbwctld\fR is being run on a non-default
port number. If an IPv6 address is being specified, note that the accepted
format contains the \fIsendhost\fR portion of the specification in square
brackets as: [fe80::fe9f:62d8]:4823.
This ensures the port number is distinct from the address specification, and
is not needed if the :port suffix is not being used.
.RS
.PP
At least one of the \fB\-c\fR or \fB\-s\fR options must be specified. If
one of them is not specified, it is assumed to be the \fIlocal\fR.
.PP
\fIauthmethod\fR is a specifically ordered list of keywords that
is only needed if authenticated communication is wanted with \fIsendhost\fR.
These keywords are used
to describe the type of communication and authentication that should be
used to contact the \fIsendhost\fR.
If \fIrecvhost\fR and \fIsendhost\fR share
the same authentication methods and identities, it is possible to
specify the authmethod for both \fIrecvhost\fR and \fIsendhost\fR
using the \fB\-A\fR argument.
An \fIauthmethod\fR specified with
the \fB\-s\fR option will override an \fIauthmethod\fR specified
with the \fB\-A\fR argument for communication with the \fIsendhost\fR.
.PP
The format for \fIauthmethod\fR and a description of the
currently available authentication
methods are described with the \fB\-A\fR argument.
.RE
.TP
\fB\-U\fR
.br
This option has been deprecated. Originally, it was used to specify the username
to identify the AES key for authentication.
All authentication options can now be specified
using the \fB\-A\fR argument.
For the next several versions this option will
report an error. Eventually, it may be reclaimed for another purpose.
.SS Throughput Test Arguments:
The arguments were named to match their counterparts in \fBIperf\fR
as closely as possible.
.PP
Some of the options are not available for some of the
throughput testers. BWCTL does not support UDP tests, changing the output format or
changing the output units for either \fBNuttcp\fR or \fBThrulay\fR.
.TP
\fB\-T\fR
Specify which throughput tester to use:
.RS
.IP \fBiperf\fR
.IP \fBthrulay\fR
.IP \fBnuttcp\fR
.IP Default:
None. Selects a tool that the client and server have in common
.RE
.TP
\fB\-S\fR \fITOS\fR
.br
Set the TOS byte in the sending packets.
.IP Default:
None.
.RE
.TP
\fB\-D\fR \fIDSCP\fR
.br
Set an RFC 2474 style DSCP value for the TOS byte in the sending packets. This
can be set using a 6-bit numeric value in decimal, hex, or octal. Additionally,
the following set of symbolic
\fBDSCP\fR name constants are understood. (Example applications are taken
from RFC 4594.)

.SS Scheduling Arguments:
.TP
\fB\-a\fR \fIsyncfuzz\fR
.br
Allow \fBbwctl\fR to run without a synchronized system clock. Use this to
specify how far off the local clock is from \fBUTC\fR. \fBbwctl\fR
prefers to have an \fBNTP\fR synchronized system clock to ensure the two
endpoints of the test are actually agreeing to the same scheduled time window
for test execution.
.RS
.PP
If two systems do NOT have a close enough notion of time, then
the throughput test will eventually fail because one endpoint of the test
will attempt to run at a different time than the other.
.PP
If the operating system supports the \fBNTP\fR system calls, and the system
clock is determined to be unsynchronized, error messages will still
be reported depending upon the value of the \fI\-e\fR flag.
.PP
When calculating the time errors, this value will be aded in to account for the
difference. The maximum time offset can be bounded on the server side, using
the max_time_error directive, to prevent a denial of service attack. If set,
the server will reject any requests to test with a peer that has too high a
timestamp error.
.IP Default:
Unset (Defaults to Set for systems without the \fBNTP\fR system calls)
.RE
.TP
\fB\-I\fR \fIinterval\fR
Specifies that \fBbwctl\fR should attempt to run a throughput test every
\fIinterval\fR seconds.
.RS
.IP Default:
Unset. If it is unset, \fBbwctl\fR only runs the test once.
.RE
.TP
\fB\-L\fR \fIlongest\fR
Specifies the longest amount of time the client is willing to wait for a
reservation window. When \fBbwctl\fR requests a test from the \fBbwctld\fR
server, it specifies the earliest time and the latest time it is willing
to accept. The latest time is determined by adding this \fIlongest\fR
option to the earliest time. The earliest time is essentially 'now'.
The \fIlongest\fR time is specified as a number of seconds.
.RS
.IP Default:
If \fIinterval\fR is set, the default is 50% of \fIinterval\fR. Otherwise,
the default is twice the test duration \fItime\fR but no smaller than
5 minutes. (See \fB\-t\fR.)

\fB\-R\fR \fIalpha\fR
Randomize the start time of the test within this \fIalpha\fR percent of the
\fIinterval\fR. Valid values for \fIalpha\fR are from 0\-50. \fBbwctl\fR
will attempt to run the test every \fIinterval\fR +/\- \fIalpha\fR percent.
For example, if the \fIinterval\fR is 300 seconds and \fIalpha\fR is
set to 10 percent, then \fBbwctl\fR will attempt to run a test every
270\-330 seconds. This option is only useful with the \fB\-I\fR option.
