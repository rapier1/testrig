.SH DESCRIPTION
.B bwctld
is a server program designed to schedule and run \fBIperf\fR, \fBThrulay\fR or
\fBNuttcp\fR throughput tests. These tests can measure
maximum TCP bandwidth, with various tunable options available, or, by doing a
UDP test, he delay, jitter and datagram loss of a network.
.PP
Aside from actually running throughput tests, the main function of
\fBbwctld\fR is to determine which tests are allowable based upon
the policy restrictions configured by the system administrator.
.PP
\fBbwctld\fR was designed to be run as a stand-alone daemon process. It
uses the classic accept/fork model of handling new requests.
.PP
Most of the command line options for \fBbwctld\fR have analogous options
in the \fBbwctld.conf\fR file. The command line takes precedence.
.SH OPTIONS
.TP
.BI \-a " auth_mode"
Specify the authentication modes the server is willing to use for
communication. \fIauth_mode\fR should be set as a character string with
any or all of the characters "AEO". The modes are:
.RS
.IP \fBA\fR
[\fBA\fR]uthenticated. This mode encrypts the control connection.
.IP \fBE\fR
[\fBE\fR]ncrypted. This mode encrypts the control connection. If the
test supports encryption, this mode will additionally encrypt the test
stream. (Encryption of the test stream is not currently supported, so
this mode is currently identical to authenticated.)
.IP \fBO\fR
[\fBO\fR]pen. No encryption of any kind is done.
.PP
The server can specify all the modes with which it is willing to communicate. The
most strict mode that both the server and the client are willing to use
will be selected.
.IP Default:
"AEO".
.RE
.TP
.BI \-c " conf_dir"
Specify the directory that holds the \fBbwctld\fR configuration files.
.RS
.IP Default:
Current working directory.
.RE
.TP
.BI \-e " facility"
Syslog \fIfacility\fR to which messages are logged.
.RS
.IP Default:
LOG_DAEMON
.RE
.TP
.B \-f
Enables the \fBbwctld\fR daemon to run with \fIroot\fR permissions. There are
legitimate reasons to run \fBbwctld\fR as root, but it is risky. Forcing this
additional option will make it less likely root permissions are accidently
used.
.TP
.BI \-G " group"
Specify the gid for the \fBbwctld\fR process. \fIgroup\fR can
be specified using a valid group name or by using \-gid. This option is
only used if \fBbwctld\fR is started as root.
.TP
.B \-h
Print a help message.
.TP
.BI \-R " var_dir"
Specify the directory to hold the bwctld.pid file.
.RS
.IP Default:
Current directory
.RE
.TP
.BI \-S " nodename:port"
Specify the address and port on which \fBbwctld\fR will listen for requests.
\fInodename\fR can be specified using a DNS name or using the textual
representation of the address. It is possible to set the source address
without setting the \fIport\fR simply by leaving off the ':' and \fIport\fR
specification. If an IPv6 address is specified, note that the accepted format
contains \fInodename\fR in square brackets, such as: [fe80::fe9f:62d8]. This
ensures the port number is distinct from the address specification.
.RS
.IP Default:
\fInodename\fR is wildcarded as any currently available address.
\fIport\fR is 4823.
.RE
.TP
.BI \-U " user"
Specify the uid for the \fBbwctld\fR process. \fIuser\fR can
be specified using a valid user name or by using \-uid. This option is
only used if \fBbwctld\fR is started as root.
.TP
.B \-Z
Run the master \fBbwctld\fR process in the foreground. In this mode, error
messages are printed to stderr as well as being sent to syslog. Also, normal
terminal controls are available. (i.e., <Cntr\-C> will cause the daemon to
kill it's child processes and exit.) This is useful for debugging.

.SH REQUIREMENTS
The \fBbwctld\fR daemon prefers a reasonably synchronized clock. It is
scheduling tests and needs to be sure it has the same idea of when a test
should take place as does the peer test system.
Therefore, \fBbwctld\fR attempts to use NTP specific system calls to determine
the accuracy of the local clock. If those system calls are unavailable, or
the administrator has set the \fIallow_unsync\fR option in the \fBbwctld.conf\fR
file, then \fBbwctld\fR will blindly accept tests assuming the clock is
synchronized to within the \fIsync_fuzz\fR value that is also defined
in the \fBbwctld.conf\fR file. If this assumption does not hold true, then
the test will eventually fail. Unfortunately, because the time offset
is not detected early, this test will have taken up a schedule slot.
